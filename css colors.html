   <h2>1. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
     </h2>
     <p> Vehicles powered solely by one or more electric batteries are known as BEVs.<br> They are more popularly called EVs. Chargeable batteries power them, and there is no IC engine (petrol or diesel-powered).<br> All the power comes from the battery pack, which is chargeable from the electricity grid.<br> The charged battery pack sends power to one or more electric motors to move the vehicle. </p>
     <h2>2. Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)</h2>
     <p>HEVs use an IC engine and an electric motor. The latter derives power from the electricity stored in a battery pack.<br> The main difference between pure EVs and HEVs is that the HEVâ€™s battery pack is charged through regenerative braking and engine power, not the regular electric charger.</p>
     <h2>3. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</h2>
     <p>PHEVs are an extended form of HEVs. They have an internal combustion engine and an electric motor.<br> However, the latter receives power from a chargeable battery, unlike standard HEVs</p>
